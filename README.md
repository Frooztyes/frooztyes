### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ it's Yanis 'Frooztyes' MIOLLANY!

Currently doing a Master 2 in Computer Science, specializing in video game programming, I love developing video games!
I mainly develop on *Unity* and *Unreal* (âš¡long live C# and C++!âš¡).

Check my favorites video game projects : 
- [Evodoom](https://github.com/Frooztyes/gamagora-evodoom) : action adventure game in a procedurally generated world
- [Pydergh !](https://github.com/Frooztyes/M2_Gamagora/tree/main/IA_JV/Pydergh) : mini game developed on Unreal in C++ using my own implementation of a boid simulation algorithm
- [Tiny Tower](https://github.com/Frooztyes/M2_Gamagora/tree/main/IA_JV/TinyTower) : mini game developed on Unity using my own implementation of A* and Dijkstra
